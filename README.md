# Drupal base image

This image is intended to provide a basic runtime for your Drupal projects. This was written for CI but could be used for running within your compose setup as well. Currently, the image is very similar to the [official Drupal image](https://hub.docker.com/_/drupal) except that it does not contain Drupal itself.
